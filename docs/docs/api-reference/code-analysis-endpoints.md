# Code Analysis Endpoints

All paths are under `/api/v1`. Every endpoint here requires a Bearer
token and respects the H.2 scope filter — regular users only see
their own scans + scans from peers they share a User Group with;
admins see everything.

## Projects

### List projects

```http
GET /projects?skip=0&limit=100&search=<term>
```

Paginated; response items carry a `stats` rollup (risk score,
severity buckets, fixes-ready count) derived from the latest terminal
scan per project.

### Create a project

```http
POST /projects
{ "name": "payments-api" }
```

Creates an empty project — typically not needed; the first scan
submission auto-creates its project by name.

### Project name autocomplete

```http
GET /projects/search?q=<term>
```

Returns a list of project names visible to the caller. Used by the
TopNav search combobox.

## Submit a scan

```http
POST /scans
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Required form fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `project_name` | Creates the project on first use; reuses it on subsequent submissions. |
| `scan_type` | `AUDIT` (read-only) or `REMEDIATE` (includes fix application later). |
| `frameworks` | Comma-separated framework names (e.g. `asvs,proactive_controls`). |
| `utility_llm_config_id` / `fast_llm_config_id` / `reasoning_llm_config_id` | UUIDs of registered `LLMConfiguration` rows. Any missing slot falls back to the first registered config. |

Exactly one submission method:

- `files`: multipart file uploads.
- `repo_url`: a public Git URL. Use `POST /scans/preview-git` first
  to confirm the repo is readable.
- `archive_file`: `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. Use `POST /scans/preview-archive`
  first to list contents.

Optional: `selected_files` is a comma-separated list of paths —
submitted files outside this list are excluded from the scan.

Response: `{ scan_id, project_id, message }`. The scan enters the
`QUEUED` state; poll status via SSE or `GET /scans/{id}`.

## Approve / cancel the cost estimate

```http
POST /scans/{scan_id}/approve        # flip from PENDING_COST_APPROVAL → QUEUED_FOR_SCAN
POST /scans/{scan_id}/cancel         # flip to CANCELLED
```

Approve publishes to `analysis_approved_queue`; the worker resumes
the paused LangGraph thread with `Command(resume=...)`.

## Stream scan progress (SSE)

```http
GET /scans/{scan_id}/stream
```

Server-Sent Events. Emits a `scan_state` event on every status
transition, a `scan_event` for each new `ScanEvent` row, and a
terminal `done` event when the scan reaches a final state. The
client reconnects via EventSource's native retry.

Because browsers can't set arbitrary headers on an `EventSource`,
the endpoint reads the access token from the `token` query param via
`current_active_user_sse`.

## Apply fixes

```http
POST /scans/{scan_id}/apply-fixes
{ "finding_ids": [101, 102, 103] }
```

Starts an incremental remediation run. The worker applies each fix
in order; a merge agent resolves conflicts when multiple fixes touch
the same file. Status lands at `REMEDIATION_COMPLETED` on success.

## Preview endpoints

```http
POST /scans/preview-archive
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Returns `{ "files": [<path>, ...] }` — list the contents of an
archive before uploading it for scan, so users can populate the
Submit page's selective-files tree.

```http
POST /scans/preview-git
{ "repo_url": "https://github.com/…" }
```

Clones the repo into a temp dir, returns a file list, discards the
clone. Rejects repos that yield zero analyzable files.
