# Installation Guide

The Secure Coding Platform is designed for local setup and deployment using Docker and Docker Compose. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system:

* **Docker Engine**: Make sure Docker is installed and the Docker daemon is running.
    * *Download*: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (includes Docker Compose for Mac and Windows).
* **Docker Compose**:
    * Usually included with Docker Desktop.
    * For Linux, if it's not included or you need a specific version, follow the [official Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* **Git**: Required for cloning the project repository.
    * *Download*: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* **Code Editor**: A code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or others for viewing and editing configuration files.
* **(Optional for specific host commands) Python & Poetry**: If you plan to run backend commands (like Alembic migrations) directly on your host machine instead of inside Docker (not recommended for initial setup), you'll need Python (version 3.12+) and Poetry installed.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal and clone the Secure Coding Platform repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nerdy-krishna/secure_coding_platform.git
    cd secure-code-platform
    ```
    Replace the URL with the actual link to the project's GitHub repository.

2.  **Create and Configure the Environment File (`.env`)**:
    The platform uses a `.env` file in the project root for configuration.
    * Copy the example environment file to a new `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        If `.env.example` is not available (it should be committed to your repository), you'll need to create `.env` manually based on the requirements below.
    * **Edit the `.env` file** with your preferred text editor. Pay close attention to the following critical variables:
        * `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`: Credentials for the PostgreSQL database.
        * `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER`, `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS`: Credentials for RabbitMQ.
        * `SECRET_KEY`: **Crucial for security.** Generate a strong, unique random string (e.g., using a password manager or the command `openssl rand -hex 32`).
        * `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: API keys for the LLM providers you intend to use.
        * `APP_PORT`: The port on your host machine that will map to the backend application (default is usually `8000`).
        * `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: A comma-separated list of origins allowed for CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for the default frontend development server).
    * For a detailed explanation of all environment variables, please refer to the [**Configuration**](./configuration.md) page.

3.  **Build and Run Services with Docker Compose**:
    From the project root directory (`secure-code-platform`), execute the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will:
    * `--build`: Build the Docker image for the application and worker services as defined in the `Dockerfile` (if they haven't been built before or if the `Dockerfile` has changed).
    * Pull the official images for PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and ChromaDB if they are not already present locally.
    * Create and start all services (application, worker, database, message queue, vector database) in detached mode (`-d`), meaning they will run in the background.
    * The initial build process might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection and system resources.

4.  **Initialize the Database Schema (First-Time Setup)**:
    Once the services are running (especially the `db` service), you need to apply the database migrations to set up the necessary tables. The recommended way to do this is by executing the command within the running application container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app poetry run alembic upgrade head
    ```
    This ensures the migration runs in the correct environment with all dependencies.
    * Wait for the `db` container to be healthy before running this. You can check its status with `docker-compose ps`.
    * If this command fails, check the logs using `docker-compose logs app` and `docker-compose logs db`.

## Verifying the Installation

After completing the steps above, you can verify that the platform is running correctly:

1.  **Check Docker Containers**:
    Run `docker-compose ps`. All services (`app`, `worker`, `db`, `rabbitmq`, `vector_db`) should have a status of `Up` or `healthy`.

2.  **Access the Backend API**:
    * The FastAPI backend should be available at `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` if `APP_PORT=8000` in your `.env`).
    * You can access the API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>/docs` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/docs`). This page should load and show the available API endpoints.

3.  **Access the Frontend Application**:
    * The React frontend (served by Vite) will be available on its configured port, typically `http://localhost:5173` (check your `secure-code-ui` setup if you changed the port).

4.  **Check RabbitMQ Management UI**:
    * You can monitor RabbitMQ queues and exchanges via its management interface at `http://localhost:<RABBITMQ_MANAGEMENT_PORT>` (e.g., `http://localhost:15672`, using the RabbitMQ credentials from your `.env` file).

## Stopping the Platform Services

To stop all running services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
This command stops and removes the containers. Your data stored in Docker volumes (like PostgreSQL data) will persist unless you explicitly remove the volumes.

## Updating the Platform

To update to the latest version of the platform:
1.  Navigate to the project root: `cd secure-code-platform`
2.  Pull the latest changes from the Git repository: `git pull origin main` (or the relevant branch)
3.  Rebuild the images if there have been changes to `Dockerfile` or application dependencies: `docker-compose up --build -d`
4.  Apply any new database migrations: `docker-compose exec app poetry run alembic upgrade head`

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Port Conflicts**: If a service fails to start due to a port already being in use, you can change the host-side port mapping in your `.env` file (e.g., change `APP_PORT` or `RABBITMQ_PORT`) and then restart the services with `docker-compose up -d`.
* **Docker Daemon Not Running**: Ensure the Docker service/daemon is running on your system.
* **Insufficient Resources**: Docker might require a certain amount of RAM/CPU. If services are crashing, check Docker's resource allocation settings.
* **Build Failures**: If `docker-compose build` fails, check the output for specific errors. It could be network issues preventing dependency downloads or errors in the `Dockerfile`.
* **Service Connection Issues** (e.g., `app` can't connect to `db`):
    * Double-check your `.env` file for correct hostnames (usually the service names like `db`, `rabbitmq`), usernames, passwords, and database names.
    * Examine the logs for the affected services: `docker-compose logs app`, `docker-compose logs db`, `docker-compose logs worker`.
* **Alembic Errors**: Ensure the `db` service is fully up and healthy before running `alembic upgrade head`. Check database connection URLs in `.env`. The `env.py` for Alembic should correctly use these values.
