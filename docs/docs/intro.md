# Welcome to the SCCAP!

The SCCAP is an open-source, AI-powered platform meticulously designed to empower developers and security teams in the crucial task of building and maintaining secure software. We are driven by the mission to proactively embed security into the software development lifecycle.

## The Challenge We Address

In today's fast-paced development environment, ensuring code security from the outset can be challenging. Traditional reactive approaches often identify vulnerabilities late in the cycle, leading to costly rework and increased risk. The SCCAP aims to shift security left, making it an integral and accessible part of development from day one.

## What We Offer: Core Capabilities

SCCAP integrates a multi-agent LLM pipeline with curated security
knowledge bases. The platform is organized around three surfaces:

### For developers and security users

* **Live dashboard** — a real risk ring, five-bucket severity bar, 14-day scan trend sparkline, fixes-ready counter, and monthly LLM spend. Admins see a platform-wide snapshot variant.
* **Gated, user-approved scan** — every scan classifies each file (first-party / vendor / minified / static), runs a cheap deterministic pass, profiles eligible files, and pauses the LangGraph workflow with native `interrupt()`s at up to three approval gates (prescan review, profiling cost, analysis cost) before any expensive work runs. A **deep vendor scan** option gives full LLM coverage to vendor/minified assets when needed.
* **Versatile submission** — file uploads, Git repository URLs, or archive uploads (`.zip` / `.tar.gz`). GitHub repos are previewed via the GitHub API without cloning. An interactive file tree lets you include or exclude paths before estimation.
* **Multi-framework scanning** — pick any combination of the 8 bundled OWASP frameworks (ASVS, Proactive Controls, Cheatsheets, CWE Essentials, ISVS, LLM Top 10, Agentic Top 10, MASVS) plus custom frameworks ingested from CSV or Git URLs.
* **Consolidated findings + downloadable report** — per-file reasoning-model consolidation merges raw findings, followed by a global cross-file consolidation pass that unifies same-root findings across files; export any scan as an HTML, CSV, PDF, or SARIF 2.1.0 report.
* **Remediation scan mode** — submit a scan as `REMEDIATE` to generate fixes during analysis, merge overlapping edits, verify supported patches, and download the patched tree. Incremental post-result application is not implemented.
* **Per-project stats on the Projects page** — each card shows the latest terminal scan's risk score, severity bar, and fixes-ready count, no client-side heuristics.
* **Global search** — one TopNav combobox across projects, scans, and findings, always scoped to what the current user is allowed to see.
* **Durable tasks & resume/restart** — every analysis and consolidation invocation is a durable task keyed by input hash. Failed or interrupted scans can be manually resumed (reuses completed work) or restarted (reruns from the original snapshot), preserving full audit history.
* **LLM resilience controls** — fixed per-config concurrency, RPM/TPM budgets, retry with jitter, and circuit breakers protect provider calls. Prompt caps currently reject oversized calls; splitting/compaction remains planned work.
* **Security Advisor with live context rail** — framework-scoped chat backed by RAG retrieval, with a right-hand rail that surfaces the knowledge sources, referenced findings, and files most likely discussed.

### For security admins

* **User Groups + scoped visibility** — admins create groups and add members by email; regular users see their own scans plus any scan owned by a peer they share a group with; admins see everything.
* **First-run setup wizard** — the first registered account becomes superuser and is routed through `/setup` before the rest of the app unlocks.
* **Unified Admin console** — LLM configurations, user groups, users, frameworks (with CSV / git-URL RAG ingestion), agents, prompt templates, SMTP, system config, and runtime logs. A shared sub-nav keeps every surface one click apart.
* **Encrypted secrets** — every LLM API key and SMTP password is Fernet-encrypted at rest with the installation's `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

### Pentesting (opt-in, feature-gated)

A separately gated **Pentesting** bounded context (disabled by default; enabled
through the local development profile) adds authorized black-box, gray-box, and
white-box engagements alongside Code Scan:

* **Project-linked engagements** — pentest projects own their scope and KMS-envelope-encrypted credentials; white-box runs select an immutable Code Scan snapshot through a read-only bridge. Read APIs never return credentials.
* **Deterministic safety model** — every target interaction requires authorization, tenant/attempt identity, and a pinned deterministic scope-policy decision; generation-fenced leases and atomic Execution commits keep results authoritative.
* **Bounded adaptive controller** — a model may suggest next authorized capabilities, but only committed `DecisionDelta` projections are consumed; scope, execution, budget, and finding authority stay deterministic.
* **Deterministic Web/API tool pack** — a Tool Broker and relay grants drive nmap, nuclei, ZAP, and Playwright adapters behind pinned egress and connection permits.
* **Finding truth** — Observations become ConfirmedFindings only through a configured evidence predicate or independent reproduction; tool/model output never directly confirms.
* **Cockpit, reports, and governance** — engagement/attempt/delta cockpit, immutable reports, redacted exports, retesting, and a governance overlay.

### Integrations and automation

* **MCP server** — the scan + advisor workflow is exposed as MCP tools at `/mcp`, reusing JWT auth so Claude Code, Cursor, or other agentic clients can drive the platform remotely.
* **LiteLLM-backed cost ledger** — token counting and cost estimation go through LiteLLM's community-maintained model price map, with a per-`LLMConfiguration` admin override for bespoke endpoints. Offline-pinnable via `LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP=True`.
* **Pydantic AI structured output** — every agent returns a validated Pydantic model; malformed outputs trigger a typed retry loop instead of regex fallbacks.
* **Observability** — every request gets an `X-Correlation-ID` attached to all logs; the stack ships Fluentd → Loki → Grafana dashboards out of the box.

## Our Vision & Guiding Principles

* **Comprehensive & Open Source**: We are committed to building a "full scope from day 1" platform, released under an open-source license to foster community collaboration and transparency.
* **Multi-Methodology Integration**: The platform incorporates a hybrid approach using Large Language Models (differentiated for thinking vs. code-writing), specialized security tools (SAST, SCA), dynamic Tree-sitter queries, and comprehensive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over multiple security frameworks.
* **User-Centric Design**: We aim for a user-friendly experience through intuitive chat interfaces and a detailed code analysis portal.
* **Community Driven**: We believe in the power of community to build and enhance tools that benefit everyone. We encourage contributions and feedback.

## Who Is This For?

* **Developers**: Write more secure code efficiently with AI-assisted guidance and generation.
* **Security Teams**: Streamline code reviews, enforce security standards, and gain deeper insights into application security posture.
* **DevSecOps Engineers**: Integrate automated security analysis seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines.
* **Organizations**: Reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure compliance with various standards.
* **Students & Educators**: Learn and teach secure coding practices with a practical, hands-on tool.
