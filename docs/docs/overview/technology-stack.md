# Technology Stack

## Backend

- **Python 3.12 + FastAPI** with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  for dependency management. Async everywhere (`async def` routes,
  SQLAlchemy async, `asyncpg`).
- **SQLAlchemy 2.x** with declarative `Mapped[]` models and
  **Alembic** for migrations. `prepend_sys_path = src` in
  `alembic.ini` so `env.py` imports live models directly.
- **fastapi-users** for auth with a JWT Bearer transport; a custom
  `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint supplements what fastapi-users
  ships.
- **LangGraph 1.x + LangChain 1.x** for the multi-agent workflow.
  Scan approval is a native `interrupt()` / `Command(resume=...)`
  refactor (I.1) with a Postgres-backed checkpointer keyed on
  `scan_id`.
- **LiteLLM** as the source of truth for token counting and cost
  estimation (I.2). `LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP=True` keeps it
  offline; per-`LLMConfiguration` overrides stay for bespoke
  endpoints.
- **Pydantic AI** (I.3) wraps `llm_client.generate_structured_output`
  to enforce per-call validation retries on structured responses.
- **FastMCP** (I.4) mounts the scan + advisor tool surface at `/mcp`,
  reusing the same JWT auth.

## Worker

A separate container consumes RabbitMQ via the blocking
[`pika`](https://pika.readthedocs.io/) client and runs the compiled
LangGraph workflow with an `AsyncPostgresSaver` checkpointer. Queues:
`code_submission_queue`, `analysis_approved_queue` (names live in
`src/app/config/config.py`).

## Pentesting tooling (opt-in)

The separately gated Pentesting bounded context adds its own execution plane
on top of the same RabbitMQ/Postgres spine:

- **Dedicated runners** — credential-minimal `runner_v3` with a read-only root,
  bounded workspace, explicit resolver, and pinned Host/SNI-preserving egress.
- **Tool pack** — nmap, nuclei, ZAP, and Playwright adapters run in isolated
  tool workers behind a Tool Broker, relay grants, and connection permits.
- **Queues** — `pentest_execution_queue`, `pentest_execution_v2_queue`,
  `pentest_execution_v3_queue`, `pentest_controller_queue`,
  `pentest_tool_queue_v1`, `pentest_verification_queue_v1` (RabbitMQ is
  notification-only; PostgreSQL stays authoritative).
- **Isolation** — seccomp profiles and per-profile deployment manifests
  (`deploy/helm/sccap/templates/pentest-tool-pack.yaml`, `deploy/seccomp/`).

## Data + infra

- **PostgreSQL 16** — primary store for users, scans, findings,
  chat, RAG metadata, system_config, and the `scan_outbox`
  transactional-outbox table that guarantees RabbitMQ publication
  survives a crash between commit and publish.
- **RabbitMQ** — message broker between API and worker.
- **Qdrant** — vector store for RAG (replaced ChromaDB per ADR-003).
  Embedding via `fastembed.TextEmbedding("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`
  in `infrastructure/rag/embedder.py`; vectors are byte-equivalent
  to the prior chromadb-bundled ONNX so existing collections stay
  valid. Callers go through the `VectorStore` Protocol so the store
  is swappable without touching call sites.
- **Fluentd → Loki → Grafana** — log aggregation. Every request
  carries an `X-Correlation-ID` propagated via `correlation_id_var`
  so logs stitch across services.
- **Let's Encrypt / certbot** — optional HTTPS, wired into
  `setup.sh` when the user opts in.

## Frontend (`secure-code-ui/`)

- **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript** with a feature-sliced layout:
  `app/` (providers + routes), `pages/` (route views), `features/`
  (feature-scoped components), `widgets/` (layouts), `shared/api/`
  (one service module per backend domain — all traffic goes through
  `apiClient.ts`).
- **Custom SCCAP UI primitives and CSS**; Ant Design is not installed.
- **TanStack Query** for server-state caching.
- **React Router v7** with centralized authentication/role and feature guards in `App.tsx`
  (`auth`, `unauth`, `superuser`, `root-redirect`). Every guard
  redirects to `/setup` when `isSetupCompleted === false`.

## Verification + tooling

- The inherited executable test suites were removed on 2026-08-22.
  Replacement tests are added at reproduced production seams; see the
  [Verification Strategy](../development/testing-strategy.md).
- **ruff + black + mypy** for Python lint/format/type-check.
- **ESLint + tsc** for the frontend.
- **GitHub Actions CI** runs backend lint, frontend lint + Vite build,
  `poetry.lock` drift, security checks, documentation, and Docker builds.
