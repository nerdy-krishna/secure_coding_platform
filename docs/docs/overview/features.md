# Platform Features

The SCCAP UI is organized into focused pages; the Admin console is only
visible to superusers. Every surface that lists scans, projects, or
findings is scoped through the H.2 visibility filter — regular users
see their own data plus any peer they share a **User Group** with;
admins see everything.

## Dashboard

- **Risk ring** — weighted-findings score (100 − clamp(weighted, 95),
  floor 5). Same heuristic server-side for the Dashboard, Compliance
  page, and Projects cards so numbers are consistent across surfaces.
- **Severity breakdown** — stacked bar and legend across critical /
  high / medium / low / informational.
- **14-day scan trend** — inline sparkline pulled from
  `/api/v1/dashboard/stats`.
- **Fixes-ready counter** — findings with an AI-suggested fix that
  hasn't been applied yet.
- **Monthly spend** — sum of `llm_interactions.cost` for the current
  month, constrained to the visibility scope.
- **Admin snapshot** — superusers get a platform-wide variant with
  deep links to the Groups and Users admin pages.

## Submit

- File upload, Git repository URL, or archive (`.zip` / `.tar.gz`).
  GitHub repos are previewed via the GitHub API (tree listing without
  cloning) and source files are fetched individually from raw URLs.
- Selective-files tree that lets you prune before cost estimation.
- Advanced **deep vendor scan** toggle — when on, vendor, minified, and
  static assets receive full LLM profiling and agent routing instead of
  being skipped by default; reflected in cost and time estimates.
- Two LLM slots per scan — a **utility** (cheap) model for the
  per-file profiler, and a **reasoning**
  (capable) model for analysis and consolidation. Put the same model
  in both, or split them.
- Optional **second reasoning LLM** — every analysis agent runs on
  both models and the findings union, so what one model misses the
  other may catch; each finding records which model(s) detected it.
- Per-stage temperature tunable at submit time, or disable temperature
  entirely so each model uses its provider default.
- Framework multi-select (8 bundled OWASP frameworks plus any
  admin-added custom framework).

Before analysis, every submitted file is **deterministically classified**
(first-party source, vendor, minified bundle, generated/static asset).
Vendor, minified, and static assets skip LLM profiling and full agent
routing by default while keeping SAST checks active.

Eligible files are profiled on the utility model (see
[Data Flow](../architecture/data-flow.md)). The deep analysis runs as
a single parallel pass under **adaptive per-LLM concurrency control**
that adjusts based on wait time and error signals, bounded by
per-config RPM/TPM rate limits and prompt-size guardrails. Each
analysis invocation and per-file consolidation is a **durable scan
task** persisted in a scan-scoped task ledger — if the worker is
interrupted, completed chunks are reused on resume.

After per-file consolidation a **global consolidation** pass merges
cross-file same-root findings (e.g. a missing CSP header across
multiple templates) into one multi-file finding with affected
locations on every file.

## Results

- Per-file finding panels: severity, CVSS score, suggested fix, and —
  for a consolidated finding — every affected location and the agents
  that corroborated it.
- **Download report** buttons export the scan's findings as a
  self-contained HTML page, a CSV (one row per finding), a paginated PDF,
  or SARIF 2.1.0 for code scanning integrations.
- Timeline and LLM-logs drill-downs for the full scan trail.
- **Resume / Restart** buttons for failed scans — resume reuses
  completed durable work; restart discards partial artifacts and
  reruns from the original snapshot. Both preserve audit history and
  write boundary events to the timeline.

## Projects

- Grid of projects owned by any user in the caller's visibility set.
- Per-card rollup served by `/api/v1/projects`: risk score, five-bucket
  severity bar, fixes-ready count, derived from the latest terminal
  scan.
- Card click opens the Results page for that scan.

## Compliance

- Per-framework card for the 8 bundled OWASP frameworks plus every
  custom framework in the `frameworks` table.
- Posture score + RAG document count + matched / open finding
  counts.
- Admins can deep-link to `/admin/rag` from the card to ingest the
  knowledge base for uninstalled defaults.

## Advisor

- Framework-scoped chat sessions, one LLM config per session.
- Live context rail populated from
  `/api/v1/chat/sessions/{id}/context`: knowledge sources (the
  session's frameworks), referenced findings (from the linked project's
  latest terminal scan, severity-ordered), and referenced files.
- Quick-reply chips for common prompts (finding explanation, framework
  mapping, scan summary).

## Admin console

All admin routes are superuser-gated server-side and hidden behind the
TopNav "Admin" item + an in-page `AdminSubNav` strip:

- **Platform** — system config (log level, LLM optimization mode, CORS
  settings, arbitrary key/values).
- **Users** — list, create, invite, flip is_active / is_superuser /
  is_verified.
- **Groups** (H.2) — create groups, add/remove members by email,
  drives the scan-scope filter.
- **Agents** — CRUD agent definitions used by `framework` mappings.
- **Frameworks** — CRUD frameworks + inline CSV or Git URL RAG
  ingestion.
- **Prompts** — CRUD prompt templates consumed by agents.
- **SMTP** — outbound mail config for password resets.
- **LLM configs** — encrypted provider credentials, rate limits, and
  effective-dated complete price override history.

## MCP server

FastMCP-mounted at `/mcp`, reusing the same JWT auth as the REST API.
Current tool surface:

| Tool | Backs |
|---|---|
| `sccap_submit_scan` | `scan_service.create_scan_from_*` |
| `sccap_get_scan_status` | `GET /scans/{id}` |
| `sccap_get_scan_result` | `GET /scans/{id}/result` |
| `sccap_approve_scan` | resumes the LangGraph thread with `Command(resume=...)` |
| `sccap_ask_advisor` | authenticated single-shot advisor call; skips session persistence but records user/tenant-attributed usage |

External agentic clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) authenticate with
an ordinary user JWT; all visibility-scope rules apply.

## Pentesting (opt-in)

A separately gated bounded context (disabled by default; enabled through the
local development profile) that sits alongside — and never mutates — the Code
Scan flow:

- **Pentest Projects** — project-scoped credentials (KMS-envelope encrypted,
  never returned by read APIs) and white-box selection of an immutable
  completed Code Scan snapshot.
- **Engagements** — black-box, gray-box, or white-box engagements; each
  Attempt pins its contract, policy, catalog, adapter, evidence, prompt,
  model, report, and runner versions.
- **Attempts & deltas** — immutable Attempt identity with digest-chained
  `DecisionDelta` projections; the adaptive controller consumes only
  committed deltas, never in-flight tool output.
- **Execution** — bounded actions with generation-fenced leases; an atomic
  Execution commit makes results, evidence manifests, facts, coverage,
  budgets, and events visible in one transaction.
- **Tool pack** — deterministic Web/API adapters (nmap, nuclei, ZAP,
  Playwright) brokered through relay grants and pinned egress.
- **Finding truth** — evidence-backed Observations → CandidateFinding →
  ConfirmedFinding only via a configured predicate or independent
  reproduction.
- **Cockpit & governance** — engagement/attempt/delta cockpit, immutable
  reports, redacted exports, retesting, and a governance overlay
  (Capability 13).

`docs/docs/operations/pentesting-*.md`.
