"""RabbitMQ consumer — aio_pika async native.

Replaces the old pika.BlockingConnection + thread-bridge-to-asyncio pattern
with a single asyncio event loop that does everything inline: connect to
RabbitMQ, consume messages, invoke the LangGraph workflow, ack/nack. Killed:

- `_async_loop` + daemon thread running `asyncio.new_event_loop()`
- `_pika_connection.add_callback_threadsafe` + the `_finalize_delivery` dance
- `schedule_task_on_async_loop` + `call_soon_threadsafe`
- The `asyncio_thread_worker_target` with its `run_until_complete` cleanup

Preserved: exponential reconnect backoff, scan-workflow timeout, FAILED-on-
crash DB update, duplicate-delivery idempotency precheck.

aio_pika's `connect_robust` auto-reconnects on network blips, but we still
wrap the consume loop in exponential backoff for the "RabbitMQ is down for
a while" case.
