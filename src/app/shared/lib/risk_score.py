"""Unified CVSS-weighted risk score.

`compute_cvss_aggregate(findings)` is the single source of truth for
SCCAP's per-scan and per-tenant risk numbers. It returns a float in
``[0.0, 10.0]`` (CVSS 3.x scale, one decimal). Callers adapt as needed:

- ``save_final_report_node`` rounds to ``int`` for the ``Scan.risk_score``
  ``Integer`` column (precision loss of <=0.5 is acceptable; widening
  the column is a deferred follow-up).
- ``DashboardService._risk_score`` and ``ComplianceService._score_from_aggregate``
  map the aggregate to the existing 0-100 posture scale via
  ``max(5, 100 - min(95, round(aggregate * 10)))`` so API JSON shapes
  are unchanged.

The function is pure-Python, takes a ``Sequence[Any]`` (duck-typed on
``severity``, ``cvss_score``, ``cvss_vector``), opens no DB session,
makes no network calls, and never raises. Bad inputs cascade through a
strict fallback ladder: parsed CVSS vector -> numeric ``cvss_score``
-> severity-tier weight -> ``0.0``.
