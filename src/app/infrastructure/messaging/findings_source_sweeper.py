"""Defensive backfill of `findings.source IS NULL` rows.

Feature-7 follow-up B3: the initial backfill admin script (run via
`scripts/backfill_findings_source.py`) closes historic NULLs. From
that point forward, the LLM-emitting agent stamps `source="agent"`
at write time (B1). This sweeper is a defense-in-depth catch for any
late-arriving NULL row — e.g. a future code path that forgets to set
the field, or a window where a long-running scan inserted a finding
between the backfill snapshot and the B1 fix being deployed.

Runs hourly on the API container. No-op when there are zero NULL
rows. Each pass updates a bounded batch and commits, so the sweeper
never holds long transactions.
