"""Background task that purges rows whose `expires_at` is in the past.

V14.2.7 — retention sweeper. Started from the FastAPI lifespan, mirrors
the outbox_sweeper shape. Runs hourly until the app shuts down. Each
tick deletes expired rows from `llm_interactions`, `chat_messages`,
and `rag_preprocessing_jobs` in batches.

FK ordering matters: `LLMInteraction.chat_message_id` is an FK child
of `ChatMessage`, so we must delete `llm_interactions` before
`chat_messages`. The full per-tick order is:

    llm_interactions  ->  chat_messages  ->  rag_preprocessing_jobs

Each table runs a `DELETE ... WHERE expires_at < NOW() AND
expires_at IS NOT NULL` capped at `BATCH_SIZE` rows per statement,
committed per batch, until rowcount == 0. Logs the per-table delete
count at INFO.

Operators with valuable history should bump the
`system.retention.{kind}_days` config keys BEFORE the migration runs;
otherwise the first sweeper tick after deploy may delete the bulk of
historical chat / LLM / rag rows.

Set env var `RETENTION_SWEEPER_ENABLED=false` to disable the
sweeper at startup. Defaults to enabled.
