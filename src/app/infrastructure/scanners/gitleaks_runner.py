"""Gitleaks subprocess wrapper for the deterministic SAST pre-pass.

Invokes ``gitleaks detect --no-git --config <pinned> --source
<staged_dir> --redact --report-format json --report-path
<tempfile>`` and converts each result into a
:class:`VulnerabilityFinding` carrying ``source="gitleaks"``,
``confidence="High"``, ``severity="Critical"`` (every secret is
treated as Critical so the worker-graph short-circuit in
``deterministic_prescan_node`` triggers).

NOTE on report path: Gitleaks 8.21+ does NOT honor ``--report-path
-`` as "write to stdout" — it treats ``-`` as a literal filename and
silently writes the JSON there. The runner used to do that and
swallowed every finding (stdout always 0 bytes). We now write to a
short-lived ``tempfile.mkstemp`` path, read it back, and unlink it
in a ``finally`` block.

Hardening (per the sast-prescan-followups threat model):

- N1 / M5: Pydantic ``_GitleaksResult`` allowlist contains ONLY
  ``RuleID``, ``File``, ``StartLine``, ``Description``. Fields like
  ``Match``, ``Secret``, ``Fingerprint``, ``Commit``, ``Author``,
  ``Email`` MUST NEVER reach ``VulnerabilityFinding`` — even if a
  future Gitleaks schema bump tries to add them.
- N1: ``--redact`` is passed to the binary (belt-and-suspenders) so
  the matched value is replaced before it leaves Gitleaks itself.
- N3: ``--config`` is pinned to the bundled
  ``/app/scanners/configs/gitleaks.toml`` so a user-tree
  ``.gitleaks.toml`` cannot redirect behavior. ``--no-git`` so the
  scanner walks the file tree, not the git history (the staged dir
  has no `.git`).
- M5: scanner ``stdout`` is parsed and discarded; never logged above
  DEBUG. ``cvss_vector=None`` and ``references=[]`` are hard-coded so
  even an upstream Gitleaks change cannot smuggle a secret through
  a metadata channel.
- M6: 120-second timeout; ``TimeoutExpired`` returns one Low-severity
  finding (NOT Critical — a timeout is not a confirmed secret leak;
  we don't want a timeout to trigger the BLOCKED_PRE_LLM short-circuit).
- M7: ``description`` is HTML-escaped + 200-char capped before
  reaching any LLM agent prompt.

The wrapper is ``async`` but executes Gitleaks on a worker thread via
``asyncio.to_thread``.
