"""Deterministic SAST pre-pass + the prescan-approval gate cluster.

Four nodes live here:
- `deterministic_prescan_node` runs Bandit + Semgrep + Gitleaks + OSV
  in parallel against the staged tree, persists the BOM, and seeds
  `WorkerState.findings` with `source="<scanner>"` rows.
- `pending_prescan_approval_node` is the human-in-the-loop pause when
  any findings landed; it persists state then calls `interrupt()`.
- `user_decline_node` is the terminal route when the operator chose
  Stop on the prescan card (status `BLOCKED_USER_DECLINE`).
- `blocked_pre_llm_node` is the terminal route when the operator
  declined the Critical-secret override modal (status
  `BLOCKED_PRE_LLM`).

The string names registered via `workflow.add_node(...)` in
`worker_graph.py` are part of the LangGraph checkpointer's on-disk
contract — do not rename.

    Runs bundled SAST scanners (currently Bandit; Semgrep + Gitleaks

    Per the sast-prescan threat model:
    - MUST NOT call ``interrupt()``; the cost-approval pause stays at
      ``estimate_cost_node`` (M8).
    - Pathological inputs are bounded by a per-file size cap and a
      per-scanner timeout enforced inside the wrapper (M6).
    - Files are staged into a ``tempfile`` sandbox with sanitized
      basenames so user-controlled paths cannot drive scanner argv

    - Scanner findings are persisted immediately so the checkpointer
