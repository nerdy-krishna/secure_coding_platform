"""`consolidate_and_patch` worker-graph node + tightly-scoped helpers.

Three helpers live here because they have no other consumer:
- `_verify_syntax_with_treesitter` — quick parse check used after the
  merge agent returns a candidate code block.
- `_run_merge_agent` — LLM call that merges multiple conflicting fix
  suggestions into a single drop-in replacement.
- `_resolve_file_fix_conflicts` — per-file overlap detection +
  conflict resolution; calls `_run_merge_agent`.

The string name registered via `workflow.add_node("consolidate_and_patch", ...)`
is part of the LangGraph checkpointer's on-disk contract — do not rename.

You are an expert security engineer. Your task is to merge multiple suggested fixes into a single, cohesive, and secure block of code.

RULES:
1. The final code must address ALL the identified vulnerabilities if possible.
2. If fixes are mutually exclusive, prioritize the change that resolves the highest severity vulnerability.
3. PRESERVE all existing comments unless they pose a security risk (e.g., hardcoded secrets).
4. Produce the most optimized, idiomatic code possible — do not just concatenate fixes.
5. Ensure any imports or dependencies referenced in the fix already exist in the file context.
6. Do NOT introduce new vulnerabilities (e.g., removing error handling, weakening validation).
7. The merged code MUST be syntactically valid and ready to compile/run.

ORIGINAL VULNERABLE CODE BLOCK:

{code_block}

CONFLICTING SUGGESTIONS:
{suggestions_str}

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object conforming to the MergedFixResponse schema.
The `merged_code` you provide must be a surgical, drop-in replacement for the ORIGINAL VULNERABLE CODE BLOCK. It must ONLY contain the specific lines that are changing. Do not include surrounding, unchanged code like function definitions or block delimiters.
Crucially, the `original_snippet_for_replacement` field in your JSON response MUST be an EXACT, character-for-character copy of the 'ORIGINAL VULNERABLE CODE BLOCK' provided above.
The `merged_code` field should contain ONLY the final, corrected code that will replace the original block. DO NOT include the original code in the `merged_code` field.
