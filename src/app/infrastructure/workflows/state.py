"""Shared TypedDicts for the worker LangGraph workflow.

Hoisted out of `worker_graph.py` so the per-node modules under
`workflows/nodes/` can import the state types without creating an
import cycle through `worker_graph.py` itself (G1 from the
split-worker-graph threat model).

Both `WorkerState` and `RelevantAgent` are re-exported from
`worker_graph.py` for back-compat — historic callers (e.g.
`workers/consumer.py`, the LangGraph checkpointer) keep importing
from the original location.
