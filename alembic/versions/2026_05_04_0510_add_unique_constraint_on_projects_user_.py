"""add unique constraint on projects (user_id, name)

The repo has been doing `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name, user_id) DO NOTHING`
since V15.4.2 (scan_repo.get_or_create_project) to avoid a TOCTOU race on
project creation, but the matching unique constraint was never added to
the table. PostgreSQL fails the ON CONFLICT clause with
`InvalidColumnReferenceError: there is no unique or exclusion constraint
matching the ON CONFLICT specification`, and every scan submission 500s.

This migration adds the missing constraint. The natural key is
`(user_id, name)`: a user can have many projects, names need only be
unique within a user.
