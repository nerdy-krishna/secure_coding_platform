"""Pin the back-compat import surface of `worker_graph` after the
split-worker-graph refactor (2026-04-26 / G8 of the threat model).

The node implementations now live in `app.infrastructure.workflows.nodes.*`
but `consumer.py` and the existing `tests/test_worker_graph_*.py` files
import names directly from `worker_graph` via either `from ... import`
or `worker_graph.<name>` attribute access. This test pins both surfaces
so an accidental rename / dropped re-export breaks loudly.

It also smoke-tests that `get_workflow()` compiles by stubbing out the
checkpointer's psycopg connection — no real DB call is needed.
