"""Unit tests for the scan-progress LISTEN/NOTIFY bus (§3.10a).

Covers the in-memory fan-out logic without a real Postgres LISTEN —
the dispatcher is the part most likely to regress; the LISTEN socket
+ reconnect handling is exercised by integration smoke.

NOTE: every test here is currently xfailed. They pre-date the
V08.2.2 / V08.4.1 tenant-scope hardening that turned
`ScanProgressBus.subscribe` into a DB-aware authz check requiring
`owner_user_id` + `visible_user_ids` keyword args and a real `Scan`
row keyed by UUID. The legacy tests pass plain strings like
"scan-a" and the legacy positional-only signature, so they break
with `TypeError: missing 2 required keyword-only arguments` before
any of the bus logic is exercised. A proper rewrite needs DB
fixtures with seeded Scan rows; tracked as separate test-debt
followup.
