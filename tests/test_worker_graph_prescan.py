"""Focused unit tests for ``deterministic_prescan_node``.

A full end-to-end LangGraph compile-and-run is out of scope for a Low-risk
single-PR slice (would require seeding a Scan + ORIGINAL_SUBMISSION
snapshot in the test DB, plus driving the AsyncPostgresSaver through
the cost-approval interrupt). These tests instead exercise the node
in isolation and rely on:

- The graph wiring being verified at code-review / manual-smoke time.
- The node never calling ``interrupt()`` (asserted structurally below).
- Persistence happening EXACTLY ONCE per scan, in this node
  (``deterministic_prescan_node``). It used to live in the downstream
  ``pending_prescan_approval_node`` / ``user_decline_node`` /
  ``blocked_pre_llm_node`` / ``save_results_node`` — but those run
  multiple times per scan (LangGraph re-enters interrupted nodes from
  the top on resume, and ``save_results_node`` runs alongside the
  prescan rows again at the end), and each `save_findings` call was
  inserting the same prescan row another time. Three or four duped
  rows per finding showed up on the results page. Pinning persistence
  to this single never-re-entered node fixes that.
