"""Unit tests for the Bandit subprocess wrapper.

These tests run inside Docker because Bandit must actually execute on
real files (M1 + M6 mitigations are about subprocess behavior). The
"timeout" and "binary missing" branches are exercised via monkeypatch
so we don't need to rely on platform-specific signals.
