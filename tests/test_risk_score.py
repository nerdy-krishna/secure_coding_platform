# tests/test_risk_score.py
"""Unit tests for `app.shared.lib.risk_score.compute_cvss_aggregate`.

The aggregator is pure-Python (no DB, no I/O) so these tests run
without any docker / fixture scaffolding. They guard the eight
mitigations from the cvss-weighted-risk-score threat model: each
malformed-input path falls through cleanly, the function never raises,
WARN logs do not echo attacker-controlled finding content, and the
function is incapable of opening a DB session or mutating its inputs.
